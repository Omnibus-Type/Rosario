Rosario is a singular typeface with 4 weight variants, plus matching italics. Its grace lies in the classic proportions. Its weak endings make it subtle, yet dynamic. Named after a crowded city, it is suitable for diverse publishing contexts, such as popular magazines, poetry books, illustrated editions and academic journals. It was designed by Héctor Gatti initially for private use, later on developed by the Omnibus-Type Team, and optimized by Adobe Fonts.
